# About Me

Numbers, logic, and systems have always sparked my curiosity. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering and quickly found my passion at the intersection of <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>business strategy</strong>, and <strong>software development</strong>. I'm not just someone who crunches numbers — I use data to <strong>tell stories</strong>, <strong>solve real business problems</strong>, and build <strong>automated systems</strong> that drive efficiency.

With a solid foundation in both analytics and development, I’ve worked across departments.
As a <strong>Business</strong> & <strong>Data Analyst</strong> and <strong>ASP.NET</strong> <strong>Developer</strong>, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, designing interactive dashboards, and developing web applications that optimize business operations. My approach blends analytical rigor with technical skills to deliver clear, impactful solutions.

<!-- Hello! I'm a versatile IT professional with experience spanning system engineering, web development, and IT security. I'm passionate about creating robust, secure applications and maintaining efficient systems. -->

## Why I Do What I Do

For me, it’s never just about writing code or creating dashboards — it’s about making a meaningful impact. I excel in identifying hidden inefficiencies and designing solutions that address persistent challenges. My goal is to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive real business value.

For example, I developed a dynamic KPI dashboard that empowered leadership with real-time visibility into team performance. I also automated a multi-step email notification system for the service department, significantly reducing manual effort and improving communication speed.

I constantly ask “why” — not to complicate things, but because digging deeper leads to smarter solutions, more accurate reports, and better-informed decisions.

## Professional Background

- Developed custom data models and KPI dashboards for cross-functional departments using <strong>Power BI</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>Looker Studio</strong>

- Automated manual workflows using <strong>ASP.NET</strong> (<strong>C#</strong>) and <strong>Google Apps Script</strong>, streamlining reporting and improving accuracy

- Designed and implemented web-based tools and ERP extensions that reduced turnaround time for decision-making by over 60%
