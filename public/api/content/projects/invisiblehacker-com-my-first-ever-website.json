    "summary": "Despite its intriguing name, the site focused on ethical programming resources, particularly C language tutorials and exercises. The project featured a responsive layout with a dark-themed UI inspired by early 2000s 'hacker aesthetics,' custom navigation, and categorized sections for programming content. This entirely hand-coded project established strong web development fundamentals and ignited a lasting passion for software development.
